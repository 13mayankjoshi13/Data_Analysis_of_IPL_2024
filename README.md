IPL 2024 Player Performance Analysis

This project involves analyzing the performance data of players from IPL 2024. The aim is to gain insights into player performance, identify top performers, and build predictive models using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to predict player performance and team composition.

Features:-

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming IPL player data into a usable format for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing player performance metrics such as runs, strike rate, and wickets to identify trends and patterns.

Statistical Analysis: Using descriptive statistics to analyze and compare players' performances across different metrics.

Machine Learning Models: Applying various machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification) to predict player performance and team composition.

Deep Learning: Implementing deep learning techniques for more advanced predictive modeling and player performance analysis.

Team Formation: Using player performance metrics to form optimal teams based on IPL 2024 data.

Tools and Technologies:-

Python   
Pandas, NumPy     
Matplotlib, Seaborn    
Scikit-learn (ML models)    
TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)    
Jupyter Notebooks    
Dataset   

The dataset contains performance statistics for IPL 2024 players and can be accessed throught this github repository.
